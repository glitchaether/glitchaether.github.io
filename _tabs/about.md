# Hello
Thanks for checking out my portfolio.
It's still a work in progress, but I'll be adding new projects and updates soon.

# My Journey
## Early Beginnings
About five or six years ago, my parents got me a new MacBook - a big step up from my old Samsung laptop from 2003 with an Intel Dual Core processor. Back then, even opening a simple text editor could take up to twenty minutes.
With the new laptop, I started exploring software and found Scratch, where I made my first basic games. After a while, I hit the limits of what Scratch could do and wanted to try something beyond 2D games. While playing Flood Escape on Roblox, I realized Roblox had its own development tool: Roblox Studio.
At first, Roblox Studio felt overwhelming, so I took a break from it. Later on, I came across a Polish YouTube series teaching Luau scripting, which helped me learn the basics. That's when I started taking programming more seriously.

## First Commission Experience
In February 2022, I joined a small Polish development team working on a Tower Defense Simulator (TDS)-style game. I didn't have much experience at the time, but I decided to learn as much as I could by following tutorials and studying examples.
After a few months, we launched an alpha version of the game. It still had plenty of issues, but the process taught me a lot about teamwork, problem-solving, and game development. I eventually left the project for personal reasons, but I came away with a solid foundation in scripting and organizing projects.

## Rediscovering Motivation
After a handful of smaller projects that never quite finished, I took a short break from development. During that time, I came across a video explaining how bigger studios organize their Roblox projects using Rojo, Wally, Visual Studio Code, and Git.
That discovery completely changed how I worked. I learned to organize my code professionally, use version control, and bring outside tools into my workflow. That was the start of a much more disciplined and professional approach to development.

## Lessons from Commission Work
To get more experience and build my portfolio, I started taking on commissions - some paid, some unpaid. While some projects went smoothly, I also ran into a few unprofessional clients and even a couple of scams.
Even with those setbacks, each project taught me something. I got better at communicating, learned the importance of clear expectations, and saw how valuable professional boundaries are. I also learned how to handle tough situations and maintain trust in my client relationships.

## Taking My Work Seriously
Right now, I'm focused on writing modular, maintainable code and raising the quality of my projects. I'm working on two major developments that highlight how much I've grown technically and how I design larger systems.
This journey has had its ups and downs, but every step has helped me grow as a developer. I'm still learning, honing my skills, and building projects that reflect both creativity and professionalism.
