# My journey

## Crazy starts

Around 5-6 years ago my parents bought a brand new macbook. It was a BIG upgrade, because only laptop I had was likeon old samsung from 2003 with intel dual core. Yea basically notepad was opening for like 20 minutes lmao (Im dead serious rn). So I was so happy I started using it everyday for some time after school and randomly stumbled upon Scratch. I started coding more and more and suddenly felt a little disappointed with fact I can do only 2d games there (but for sure some people had made 3d so might be my skill issue xd) so I was later playing a roblox game called "Flood Escape" and suddenly my brain went "Oh yea... roblox has studio..." and went straight into studio. Oh my god I felt like I was behind some airplane cockpit. And when I saw that you need to write code instead of drag and drop blocks I said "hell nah" and closed it for a year. Then I stumbled upon some roblox scripting series that explains luau in my native language which is polish. And after watching them I went straight into practicing until my very first serious project.

## How I did comission with youtube ðŸ’€

Yea heh thats a... idk. Anyway on Feb 2022 I came into contact with a polish dev that were assembling a team to create a tds and I applied to this job. He asked me if I can do it and I said "yea sure" (spoiler: I didn't had clue what to do). When I saw every asset I went straight into coding and went blocked in about 1 second LMAO. So what I did was searching some "How to make tds game roblox studio tutorial" on youtube and stumbled upon a GnomeScript guy. He had started a series and it was like blessing. so what I did was copy and paste his work ðŸ’€ (peak programmer skills). Yea so later like in 4 months we released alpha (which had HELLA A LOT of bugs) and 2 months later I withdrawn from team due to personal reasons

## How I took my lazy ass from sofa and started improving

After that adventure I had some more projects. However they did not make out in the end....
